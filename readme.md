This mod makes the [Space Exploration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/se-early-spaceships) spaceships available the same time as Cargo Rockets. Theoretically you never need to build a Cargo Rocket. The goal is to allow you to build your entire interplanetary logistics infrastructure using spaceships from the start. This is now easier than ever since the addition of the spaceship scheduler allowing you to control spaceships like trains.

# Changes
- Spaceship technology now locked behind Rocket Science. (Can be researched before going to space)
- Spaceship Clamp technology now locked behind Space Science. (Can be researched right after reaching space)
- Adjusted recipes to allow crafting the basic spaceship parts on Nauvis before reaching space.


# Compatibility
- Krastorio 2 is not supported (yet).

# Credits

- This mod is based on [Early Spaceship by Messier1071](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Early-Spaceship) and [No More Rocket Man by aotho](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SENoMoreRocketMan).
